Hello and welcome to your coding interview üëã.

our team. We will go with you through a set of tasks which we ask you to solve.
The coding interview should resemble a typical pair-programming situation.
Therefore you can use all the tools available and the internet. We would like
to understand what you are thinking when you are typing, so please be verbose üó£Ô∏è.

Don't worry if you are running out of time. The goal is **NOT** to finish all
tasks. We might ask you spontaneous questions which might mean that you can not
finish.

In this interview we kindly ask you to share your screen with us. It is perfectly
OK for us if you prefer not to enable your camera. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Please close
all applications which might pop up during the Interview. We are not interested
